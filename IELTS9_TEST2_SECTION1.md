MAN: Good morning. Can I help you?  
WOMAN: Yes. I've just been accepted on a course at the university and I'd like to try and arrange accommodation in the **hall of residence**.  
MAN: Yes, certainly. Please sit down. What I'll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.  
WOMAN: Thank you.  
MAN: So first of all, can I take your name?  
WOMAN: It's Anu **Bhatt.**  
MAN: Could you spell your name please?  
WOMAN: Yes. A-N-U ... B-H-A doubles T.  
MAN: Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?  
WOMAN: **31st March 1972**.  
MAN: THank you. And where are you from?  
WOMAN: India.  
MAN: Oh right. And what will you be studying?  
WOMAN: **I'm doing a course in nursing.**  
MAN: Right, thank you. And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?  
WOMAN: Well, it'll take three years but **I'd only like to stay in hall for two**. I'd like to think about living outside for the third year.  
MAN: Fine. And what did you have in mind for catering? Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided. that's full board?  
WOMAN: Is there something in between?  
MAN: Yes. You can just have evening meal provided. which is half board.  
WOMAN: That's what I'd prefer.  
MAN: Yes, a lot of students opt for that. Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?  
WOMAN: Yes, **I don't take red meat**.  
MAN: No red meat.  
Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options. You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one. These are both what we call simple rooms. The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit which actually has more space and better facilities. There's about $20 a week difference between them.  
WOMAN: Well, actually my grant is quite generous and **I think the bedsit sounds the best option**.  
MAN: Lovely. I'll put you down for that and we'll see what availability is like. Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?  
WOMAN: Yes, of course.  
MAN: I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are. This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particlar hall.  
WOMAN: Ummm. **Well, I love the theatre.**  
MAN: Right.  
WOMAN: And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.  
MAN: That's worth knowing. Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall and we'll do our best to take these into account.  
WOMAN: Well, the first thing is **I'd prefer a hall where there are other mature students**. if possible.  
MAN: Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.  
WOMAN: Ummm and **I'd prefer to be out of town**.  
MAN: That's actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.  
WOMAN: Lucky!  
MAN: Yes, Anything else?  
WOMAN: Well, **I would like somewhere with a shared area,** a TV room for example, or something like that. It's a good way to socialise.  
MAN: It certainly is.  
WOMAN: That's it.  
MAN: Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.  
WOMAN: Sure, I'll just find it. It's double 67549.  
MAN: Great, so we'll be in contact with you as soon as possible...
