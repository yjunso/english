WOMAN: Yes, of course. Can I take your name?  
MAN: It's Peter Chin.  
WOMAN: Okay Peter. Well, if you want to ask about the job and then if we're both still interested. we could arrange for you to come for an interview.  
MAN: Great. thanks. I'm afraid I missed the advert for the job but heard about it form a friend.  
WOMAN: That's no problem at all. What would you like to know?  
MAN: Well, um, what sort of work is it - washing up?  
WOMAN: It's **answering the phone.**  
MAN: Oh right, fine.

MAN: That's be good. And how many rights a week would it be?  
WOMAN: Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.  
MAN: So two nights?

MAN: That'd be fine. It wouldn't interfere with my studies.  
WOMAN: Are you at the university?  
MAN: Yes. First year Physics student.  
WOMAN: Oh, right.  
MAN: Um, and because I'm not an EU national would I need a work permit?

### SECTION 2  
ANDREW: Now we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what's happening in town this weekend.  
JANE: Right, thanks Andrew, and now what's new, and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster? Well, most of you probably know Sports World - **the branch of a Danish sports goods company** that opened a few years ago - it's attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. It's going to be in the shopping center to **the west of Bradcaster.** so that will be good news for all of you who've found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.  
I was invited to a special preview and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing. The whole place has been given a new minimalist look with the company's signature colours of black and red.  
**The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing** as well as equipment, and on the top floor there's a cafe and a book and DVD section. You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones. If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock they **promise to get it for you in ten days.** Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but **they particularly focus on running.** and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. As well as that, a whole section of **the third floor is devoted to sports bags.** including the latest designs form the States - if you can't find what you want here, it doesn't exist!  
The Shop will be open from 09:00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you'll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who's coming along to open the shop, and **he will be staying around until about midday** to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.  
Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend. There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competiton open to all. Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly to win a signed copy of Paul King's DVD 'Spring Tips', while **the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year's free membership of the Bradcaster Gym.** All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.  
One of the special opening offers is a fitness test - a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff. **This would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only. There are only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking** phone 560341. In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers including the chance to try out equipment at special open evenings...
