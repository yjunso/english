MAN: It's Peter Chin.  
WOMAN: Okay Peter. Well, if you want to ask about the job and then if we're both still interested. we could arrange for you to come for an interview.  
MAN: Great. thanks. I'm afraid I missed the advert for the job but heard about it form a friend.

MAN: Well, um, what sort of work is it - washing up?  
WOMAN: It's answering the phone.  
MAN: Oh right, fine.

MAN: That's be good. And how many rights a week would it be?  
WOMAN: Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.  
MAN: So two nights?

MAN: That'd be fine. It wouldn't interfere with my studies.  
WOMAN: Are you at the university?  
MAN: Yes. First year Physics student.  
WOMAN: Oh, right.  
MAN: Um, and because I'm not an EU national would I need a work permit?

MAN: Right, better that hostel food!  
WOMAN: We certainly hope so! And we also offer extra pay for working on national holidays.  
MAN: Oh, that's a really good perk, isn't it?  
WOMAN: Yes. we think so. And then because of the difficulties of getting public transport, if you're working after 11 o'clock we drive you home.
