### SECTION 4  
  
Good morning everyone. Now whether you're going to university to study business or some other subject, many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.  
  
Now, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you've joined has certain characteristics. And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation - this includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that. One well known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.  
  
The first type is called the Power Culture, and it's usually found in small organisation.  
  
**It's the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective**, and because control is in the hands of just one or two people there aren't many rules or procedures.  
**Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations** rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos. Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly, so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.  
  
**But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn't always act effectively**, because it depends too much on one or two people at the top, and when these people make poor decisions there's no-one else who can influence them.  
  
And **the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take risks**. and for whom job security is a low priority.  
  
The next type is known as Role Culture - that's R-O-L-E, not R-O-double L, by the way, and this type is usually found in large companies, which have **lots of different levels** in them.  
These organisations usually have separate departments that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever. Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers, and typically everyone's job is controlled by **sets of rules and procedures-for example, there are specific job descriptions**.
