### SECTION 4    
Good afternoon everyone. Well, with some of you about to go out on field work it's timely that in this afternoon's session I'll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and, most often, die in what are known as 'mass strandings'.  
  
Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you'll be travelling to, where sometimes **the tide goes out suddenly,** confusing the animals.  
However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.  
  
The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites. It's often found that sranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites. For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales. **Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate, this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful**.
